A tailored LMS for my website [consitech.it](https://consitech.it) now deployed on [https://lms.consitech.it/](https://lms.consitech.it/).

The objective of this project is to develop an e-learning platform dedicated to coding, integrating YouTube videos and a code editor that follows the recorded video in real time, allowing users to add notes. Additionally, a dedicated code editor will be provided for experimentation with code.

# Consitech LMS (front-end)
A tailored LMS for my website [consitech.it](https://consitech.it).

The objective of this project is to develop an e-learning platform dedicated to coding, integrating YouTube videos and a code editor that follows the recorded video in real time, allowing users to add notes. Additionally, a dedicated code editor will be provided for experimentation with code.

## List of utlilized languages, libraries and frameworks
